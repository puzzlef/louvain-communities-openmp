Community detection entails the identification of clusters of vertices that exhibit stronger connections within themselves compared to the wider network. The Louvain method, a commonly utilized heuristic for this task, employs a two-step process comprising a local-moving phase and an aggregation phase. This process iteratively optimizes the modularity metric, a measure of community quality. Despite its popularity, the Louvain method has been noted for producing internally fragmented and weakly connected communities. In response to these limitations, Traag et al. propose the Leiden algorithm, which incorporates a refinement phase between the local-moving and aggregation phases. This refinement step enables vertices to explore and potentially establish sub-communities within the identified communities from the local-moving phase.

However, the Leiden algorithm is not guaranteed to avoid internally disconnected communities, a flaw that has largely escaped attention. We illustrate this through both a [counterexample][report1] and [empirical findings][report1]. In our experimental evaluation, we note that approximately `1.3√ó10^‚àí4` fraction of the communities identified using the original Leiden implementation exhibit this issue. Although this fraction is small, addressing the presence of disconnected communities is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and dependability of community detection algorithms. Several studies have addressed internally disconnected communities as a post-processing step. However, this may exacerbate the problem of poorly connected communities. Furthermore, the surge in data volume and their graph representations in recent years has been unprecedented. Nonetheless, applying the original Leiden algorithm to massive graphs has posed computational hurdles, primarily due to its inherently sequential nature, akin to the Louvain method. To tackle these challenged, we propose two new *parallel algorithms*: **[GSP-Leiden]** and **[GSP-Louvain]**, based on the [Leiden] and [Louvain] algorithms, respectively.

Below we plot the time taken by the [original Leiden], [igraph] Leiden, [NetworKit] Leiden, GSP-Leiden, and GSP-Louvain on 13 different graphs. GSP-Leiden surpasses the original Leiden, igraph Leiden, and NetworKit Leiden by `341√ó`, `83√ó`, and `6.1√ó` respectively, achieving a processing rate of `328M` edges/s on a `3.8ùêµ` edge graph.

Below we plot the speedup of GSP-Leiden and GSP-Louvain wrt original Leiden, igraph Leiden, and NetworKit Leiden.

Next, we compare the modularity of communities identified by the original Leiden algorithm, igraph Leiden, NetworKit Leiden, GSP-Leiden, and GSP-Leiden. On average, GSP-Louvain achieves `0.3%` lower modularity than the original Leiden and igraph Leiden, respectively, and `25%` higher modularity than NetworKit Leiden, particularly evident on road networks and protein k-mer graphs.

Finally, we plot the fraction of disconnected communities identified by each implementation. Absence of bars indicates the absence of disconnected communities. As anticipated, both GSP-Leiden and GSP-Louvain detect no disconnected communities. However, on average, the original Leiden, igraph Leiden, and NetworKit Leiden exhibit fractions of disconnected communities amounting to `1.3√ó10^‚àí4`, `7.9√ó10^‚àí5`, and `1.5√ó10^‚àí2`, respectively, particularly on web graphs (and especially on social networks with NetworKit Leiden).
